# R_netcdf
A repo for teaching R through climate data 

This is a github repository for three R notebooks introducing R for climate science. Each file has three components, a .html file which is a rendered file showing pretty output for web browsers, a .R file showing R code and comments only, and a .Rmd R Notebook file which has interactive code as well as plot outputs and longform explanations of the code. It is recomended to open the .Rmd files in R studio as your first port of call, as this allows the code to be changed and played with.
