# R_netcdf
A repo for teaching R through climate data 

This is a github repository for three R notebooks introducing R for climate science. 

Each file has two components:

     -- a .R file showing R code and comments only
     -- a .Rmd R Notebook file which has interactive code as well as plot outputs and longform explanations of the code.

It is recomended to open the .Rmd files in R studio as your first port of call, as this allows the code to be changed and played with.
